# Day 6

Not all sleighs are made equal and as a result they have particular requirements as to the type of pilot
that can get behind the reigns. In this example test the AddDriver method on the massive MassiveSleigh,
Ensure that the criteria for a valid driver are met. Again NSubstitute is your friend in this one.

The code can be found at https://github.com/rolandsutton/festive-test-challenge/blob/main/BlueCastle.Santa.Lib/Source/day6/Sleigh.cs

So this is half way through the challenge hopefully you're not flagging too much. 
Let me know if there is any feedback as that would help me to improve things as a resource for people to use.
Good luck with the remaining days ðŸŽ…
