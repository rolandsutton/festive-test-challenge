# Day 10

In the good old day the naughty list would like be finalised in the late summer giving the elves a 
relaxing run in to the "big event" when all of the sacks could be pre packed and ready to go well in advance. 
These days the fickle nature of good behaviour and the influence of social media means that the 
Naughty List is being changed right up until the last minute. The Sleigh class has been updated so 
that if it receives a naughty list changed event that it's state is set back to Preparing. Please test 
that sleigh is behaving as expected when an event is received.
