# Information

After a night on the Egg Nog the Dev Ops elves have decided 
that maybe after all there was some room for improvement
on the driver validator, and they now have a TryIsValid method
that will indicate success and potentially return more
information about the driver.
There is no concrete implementation of IDriverInfo so for now
you'll just have to mock the interface.
## Hint
This exercise it about what NSubstitute can do for you.
