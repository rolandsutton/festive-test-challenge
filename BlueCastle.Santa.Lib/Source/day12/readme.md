Due to Claus enterprises being a progressive employer, they are committed to the well-being of their employees.
As such, they have decided to implement a new policy for the elves that work in the toy factory. Some elves have
been replaced by automation systems and the affected elves have been reassigned to the Shelf division. In this 
ambassadorial role they are a key part of servicing the recent "Elf of a Shelf" phenomen.
