# Day 12

As the generously proportioned singer gets ready to belt out the final song of the Testmas period so 
we reach the final day of Testmas. It has been brought to our attention that some of the challenges may 
have belittled  the contribution made by the seasonal Elves to delivering a successful festive period. 
Indeed without them, a significant reduction in the spreading of Joy would result. So to show how much
they 're valued we are taking this opportunity to highlight one of the key schemes that is in place to 
look after them.

Due to Claus enterprises being a progressive employer, they are committed to the well-being of their
employees. As such, they have decided to implement a new policy for the elves that work in the toy factory. 
As elves are replaced by automation systems and the affected elves have been reassigned to the Shelf division.
In this ambassadorial role they are a key part of servicing the recent "Elf of a Shelf" phenomenon.
The software has been updated to ensure that we can keep track of where the elves are and where they 
have been been.

Please test the Elf class to ensure that it behaves as expected.

As always, the code and examples can be found at https://github.com/rolandsutton/festive-test-challenge/tree/main/BlueCastle.Santa.Lib/Source/day12

So as a closing statement for this period of Testmas, many thanks to those that have participated and why
ever not to those who haven't üòâ If any one has found this useful or have any comments please let me know
as I would really appreciate being able to improve things.

And fear not for early exploratory discussions have just started with Mr E Bunny with a view to a new 
collaborative venture - watch this space üê£üê∞.

So it just leaves me to say that Unit tests are not just for Christmas, take care of them and you
will be rewarded with the feeling of safety that a software engineer longs for when a release is fast approaching.
