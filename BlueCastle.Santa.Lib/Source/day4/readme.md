# Day 4

Due to an increasing amount of joy sledging by the elves, as an extra precaution, Santa would like 
to ensure that sleighs can only be driven on Christmas Eve. Test that the sleigh will only go on
Christmas eve, You will need to write the tests using SleighV2



# Hint

Using the .net8 TimeProvider/FakeTimeProvider, SleighV2 can be tested.

Bonus Points

Claus enterprises has a potential new client Mr E. Bunny who will be using the sleighs for delivering eggs on Easter Sunday. Can you make the sleighs work for him too? This would likely mean a change to create a IDeliveryDateValidator (or name of your choice) to take care of the different dates. (I would assume as a first pass that easter is a fixed date) As simple mock would suffice to check the sledge logic.
