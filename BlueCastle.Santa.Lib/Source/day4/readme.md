# Information

As extra precaution, Santa would like to ensure that sleighs can only be driven
on Christmas Eve.

Hint
Using the .net8 TimeProvider, SleighV2 can be tested.

Bonus Points
Claus enterprises has a potential new client Mr E. Bunny who will be using the sleighs
for delivering eggs on Easter Sunday. Can you make the sleighs work for him too?
This would likely mean a change to create a IDateValidator to take care of the
different dates. (I would assume as a first pass that easter is a fixed date)
