# Day 9

After a sackfull of frustration with the SackFiller ®️ software, it was decided that Claus Industries
should write its own software to do the job. However the development overran into the Elves Christmas 
party season so they "overlooked" the need to unit test the result of their labours. 
Please could you help them out and test the SackFiller class so that they can enjoy the festive karaoke
without a dark cloud hanging over them.
