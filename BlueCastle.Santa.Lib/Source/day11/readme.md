# Day 11

As time inexorably marches on, the pipers are warming up the pipes, dear reader I must apologise for 
slackness taking hold at Testmas Towers HQ, due to IT issues relating to the Testmas IT system being 140miles
away from the developer, it has come to our attention that the suggested solution is a little incomplete as 
I've missed at least one test case. So consider that a mea cuplea but as you come so far on the Testmas
journey I'm we can just gift wrap this a puzzle for added delight for the reader (thank you for you patience ðŸ™‚)

So today we move up to the issues faced by Mission Control on the big day, the elves in charge are want
to press the big red go button so send out the Sleighs but then hit the sherry and mince pies and forget
to press the recall button to summon them all back again, leading the occasional lost sleigh still wandering
around in late February. To correct this we've created an automatic return routine that is triggered 
when Go is signalled. So your mission (should you choose to accept) is to test this functionality in the 
Mission Control class. This message will not self destruct as I have not been able to get permission to
add to the excitement that I'm sure everyone is feeling.
