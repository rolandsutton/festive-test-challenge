# Introduction
## Day 2

The elves have now realised that it is possible that the Sleigh needed more states so have added an enum
to capture the different states. Test that the states are set correctly and method returns are appropriate.
SleighV2 allows you to set the initial state of the Sleigh if you want/need to. So don't delay, it's time to
get Testive (sincere apologies for that)
